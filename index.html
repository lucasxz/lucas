    <p class="test">Hi! I'm Cheyenne, a CS sophomore at Princeton University with minors in Film, East Asian Studies, and Cognitive Science. In high school, I was involved with flute, chess, and tennis. I also scored 1600 on the SAT and have taught SAT classes, so feel free to book me if you are interested in SAT help. </p>
